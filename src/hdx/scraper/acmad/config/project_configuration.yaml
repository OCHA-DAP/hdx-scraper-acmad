cdi:
  name: acmad-combined-drought-indicator
  title: Africa - Monthly and dekadal combined drought indicator (CDI)
  notes: |-
    The Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) dataset developed at ACMAD is designed as an
    operational drought-monitoring product that synthesizes multiple biophysical signals
    into a single, coherent assessment of drought conditions across Africa. Rather than
    relying on a single indicator, the ACMAD CDI combines information from rainfall-based
    drought indices and satellite-derived vegetation condition metrics, applying
    rule-based logic to identify areas where these independent indicators consistently
    point to drought stress. This convergence approach reduces the risk of false alarms
    that can arise from short-term rainfall variability or vegetation anomalies unrelated
    to drought. The data exist in two forms one based on GPCC while another based on Era5
    precipitation.


    The dataset is particularly useful in the African context, where ground observations
    are sparse and climatic gradients are strong across regions. By using harmonized,
    gridded datasets, the CDI provides a comparable drought signal across national
    boundaries, supporting regional coordination and continental-scale analysis. Its
    categorical outputs are intentionally simple and policy-ready, making them suitable
    for drought bulletins, early-warning communications, and high-level decision support.


    Importantly, the CDI is not intended to replace detailed drought diagnostics or impact
    assessments. Instead, it serves as a convergence and confirmation tool that highlights
    areas requiring closer analysis and expert interpretation. In this role, the CDI acts
    as a bridge between complex climate data and practical drought-risk management,
    enabling timely, consistent, and defensible drought monitoring at regional and
    continental scales.
  methodology: |-
    The Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) is derived from the combination of SPI, SMA and
    fAPAR, to identify areas with the potential to suffer agricultural drought, areas
    where the vegetation is already affected by drought conditions, and areas in the
    recovery process to normal conditions after a drought episode.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    The data may require interpretation with its building blocks such as the vegetation,
    soil moisture or rainfall to fully place the cause of the drought, highly dependent
    on the data source, in this case SPI, soil moisture anomaly and vegetation anomaly
    which may vary depending with number of weather stations sharing data on a geographic location.

sma:
  name: acmad-soil-moisture-anomaly
  title: Africa - Monthly and dekadal Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA)
  notes: |-
    The Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA) dataset provides a measure of deviation in root-zone
    soil moisture conditions relative to the long-term climatological mean. Generated
    typically from hydrological models or satellite assimilation systems, this product
    highlights deficits or surpluses in soil water availability that are critical for
    agriculture and pastoralism. Because soil moisture integrates rainfall over time
    and accounts for evapotranspiration losses, SMA offers a more direct indicator of
    agricultural drought stress than precipitation deficits alone.


    This dataset is essential for monitoring the onset of agricultural drought, as soil
    moisture deficits often precede visible vegetation stress. It is widely used to
    assess potential yield reductions in rainfed agriculture and to monitor fodder
    availability in pastoral regions.
  methodology: |-
    SMA is calculated by comparing current soil moisture estimates (often from reanalysis
    data or hydrological models) against a historical baseline for the same time period.
    The anomalies are typically expressed as standard deviations from the mean or as
    percentage deviations, allowing users to identify the severity of dryness or wetness
    relative to normal conditions for that specific location and time of year.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    Soil moisture data derived from models or satellite remote sensing may have uncertainties
    related to soil texture maps, depth assumptions, and vegetation cover interference.
    Users should be aware that "root-zone" definitions vary between models and may not
    perfectly match the specific rooting depths of all local crops.

fapar_anomaly:
  name: acmad-fapar-anomaly
  title: Africa - Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) Anomaly
  notes: |-
    The fAPAR Anomaly dataset maps deviations in vegetation health and photosynthetic
    activity across Africa. fAPAR measures the proportion of solar radiation absorbed
    by plants for photosynthesis, making it a robust biophysical indicator of vegetation
    status. The anomaly product highlights areas where vegetation activity is significantly
    below or above the long-term average, serving as a primary proxy for agricultural
    production and biomass availability.


    Unlike simple greenness indices (like NDVI), fAPAR is physically related to the
    energy and mass exchange processes of the canopy. Negative anomalies in this dataset
    are strong indicators of vegetation stress caused by drought, pests, or disease,
    making it a critical input for yield forecasting and food security analysis.
  methodology: |-
    This product is derived by comparing current satellite-observed fAPAR values against
    the long-term historical average for the same dekad or month. The resulting anomalies
    indicate whether the vegetation is performing better or worse than expected. It is
    frequently used as the "impact" component in combined drought indicators, confirming
    that meteorological deficits have translated into actual biophysical stress.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    Cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols can sometimes interfere with optical satellite
    retrievals, although compositing techniques generally mitigate this. Extreme anomalies
    should be cross-referenced with rainfall or soil moisture data to confirm drought
    as the cause rather than non-climatic factors like land-use change or locust infestations.

fapar_absorbed:
  name: acmad-fapar-absorbed
  title: Africa - Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) Absolute Values
  notes: |-
    This dataset contains the absolute values of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation (fAPAR). While anomalies show deviations from the norm, these absolute
    values provide a direct measure of the current state of vegetation density and health.
    It represents the fraction of incoming solar radiation in the photosynthetically active
    spectrum that is absorbed by the canopy, ranging theoretically from 0 (bare soil) to
    1 (dense, healthy vegetation).


    Absolute fAPAR is crucial for initializing crop growth models, estimating net primary
    productivity (NPP), and monitoring the phenological development of crops and natural
    vegetation throughout the growing season.
  methodology: |-
    Derived from optical satellite sensors (such as those on Sentinel or PROBA-V, processed
    by CGLS), this product utilizes the radiative transfer properties of the canopy.
    It provides a quantitative assessment of the "green" elements of the canopy and their
    capacity to absorb energy.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    Values saturate in very dense tropical forests (though less so than NDVI). In arid
    regions with very sparse vegetation, the signal may be dominated by soil background
    reflectance. This is raw vegetation status data, not an anomaly, so interpretation
    of "drought" requires knowledge of the typical phenological cycle for the region.

spi:
  name: acmad-standardized-precipitation-index
  title: Africa - Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
  notes: |-
    The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the globally recommended standard for
    characterizing meteorological drought. It quantifies observed precipitation as a
    standardized deviation from the long-term probability distribution function for
    a specific location and time scale. This dataset typically includes multiple time-scales
    (e.g., 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month) to capture different types of drought impacts,
    from immediate soil moisture deficits to long-term hydrological stress.


    Because SPI is normalized, it allows for safe comparisons between different climatic
    zones—allowing a wet region and a dry region to be compared on the same scale of
    drought severity.
  methodology: |-
    SPI is calculated by fitting a probability distribution (usually Gamma) to long-term
    precipitation records and then transforming that distribution into a normal distribution.
    Negative values indicate dry conditions (drought), while positive values indicate
    wet conditions. The magnitude of the negative value corresponds to the severity
    of the drought (e.g., -1.5 is severe drought, -2.0 is extreme).
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    The accuracy of SPI is entirely dependent on the quality and length of the historical
    rainfall record used for the baseline. In regions with sparse gauge networks, interpolation
    errors in the input precipitation data can propagate into the SPI calculation. SPI
    does not account for temperature or evapotranspiration, only rainfall.

gpcc_monthly_precipitation:
  name: acmad-gpcc-monthly-precipitation
  title: Africa - GPCC Monthly Precipitation Product
  notes: |-
    The Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Monthly Precipitation dataset provides
    gridded gauge-analysis products focusing on land-surface precipitation. This dataset
    serves as a high-quality observational baseline for climate monitoring across Africa.
    It is constructed from quality-controlled data from thousands of rain gauges worldwide.


    At ACMAD, this data often serves as the "truth" or reference layer for calibrating
    satellite estimates and for calculating long-term indices like SPI. It is critical
    for retrospective analysis, model verification, and understanding the climatological
    context of current weather events.
  methodology: |-
    The product is based on in-situ rain gauge measurements that undergo strict quality
    control and are interpolated onto a regular grid. It distinguishes itself by using
    the largest available database of station data, making it one of the most reliable
    gridded precipitation datasets for land areas.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    As a gauge-based product, its accuracy is lower in regions with sparse station density
    (e.g., parts of the Sahara or the Congo Basin). There is typically a latency period
    for the final quality-controlled product, though "First Guess" or "Monitoring" versions
    may be available sooner.

cdi_era5:
  name: acmad-combined-drought-indicator-era5
  title: Africa - CDI based on ERA5 Precipitation
  notes: |-
    This version of the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data
    as the primary input for the precipitation component (SPI), rather than gauge-only
    or other satellite-blended products. ERA5, produced by ECMWF, offers comprehensive
    spatial coverage and temporal consistency, making it valuable for regions where gauge
    networks are failing or sparse.


    Like the standard CDI, this dataset synthesizes rainfall deficits (via ERA5), soil
    moisture anomalies, and vegetation stress into a single classification system to
    monitor the evolution of drought episodes.
  methodology: |-
    The methodology mirrors the standard ACMAD CDI: combining meteorological drought (SPI computed
    from ERA5), agricultural drought (Soil Moisture Anomaly), and vegetation impact (fAPAR).
    A convergence of evidence approach identifies where these indicators overlap to classify
    regions into categories such as "Watch," "Warning," and "Alert."
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    While ERA5 provides complete spatial coverage, it is a model reanalysis and may overestimate
    drizzle or miss localized convective storms common in the tropics. Users should compare
    this product with the GPCC-based CDI where gauge data is available to understand
    potential biases in the reanalysis inputs.

drought_to_persist:
  name: acmad-drought-forecast-persistence
  title: Africa - Drought Persistence Outlook
  notes: |-
    The Drought to Persist dataset provides a probabilistic or categorical outlook indicating
    areas where current drought conditions are expected to continue into the next forecast
    period. This product integrates the current state of drought (initial conditions from CDI
    or SPI) with seasonal or sub-seasonal climate forecasts.


    It is a key early warning tool for decision-makers, distinguishing between drought
    events that are likely to alleviate due to incoming rains and those that are entrenched
    and likely to worsen. This allows for the prioritization of resources to areas with
    chronic or intensifying stress.
  methodology: |-
    This is typically derived by combining current drought indices (monitoring) with
    precipitation forecasts (e.g., from seasonal climate outlooks or GCM ensembles).
    If a region is currently in drought and the forecast probability for precipitation
    is below normal, the drought is flagged to persist.
  caveats: |-
    Each ZIP download contains the original scanned TIFF files for a single calendar
    year, including monthly and dekadal scans. The files are provided in a ZIP archive
    to preserve the original sources and may be extracted and converted as needed.


    This product inherits the uncertainties of seasonal climate forecasts, which can be
    lower in skill during transition seasons or in specific regions of the continent.
    It represents a risk assessment rather than a deterministic prediction.
